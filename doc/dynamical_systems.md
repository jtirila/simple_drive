# Dynamical Systems and Autonomous Vehicles

In this document, I will record some important methods, external resources and my own interpretations
of any theoretical models useful for inference concerning motion of vehicles, measurement of such motion, 
and autonomous systems governing such motion.

As an initial guess, I will need to cover at least the following: 

* Dynamical systems in general
* (Hidden) Markov models and other approaches to modelling the state 
* Kalman filters and their extensions / modification
* Particle filters

As of now, I have no coherent picture of which theoretical frameworks to consider when researching the motion 
of vehicles. In this document, I hope to gradually arrive at some kind of an understanding of these concepts.
