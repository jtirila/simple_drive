# Simple_drive

This is a repository for some experiments on driving AI related technologies. There will very probably be no outcome of 
general interest, but rather some scattered notes and half-finished attempts at implementing loosely related 
pieces of functionality. 

Disclaimer: I am currently involved in the Udacity Self Driving Car Nanodegree (CarND), and much of the things I 
tinker with in this repository are somehow related to Udacity coursework. However, the actual graded CarND work happens 
elsewhere, this is more of a playground.

Another thing also sets this project apart from CarND is that I have a specific hardware platform in mind, and also 
intend to experiment with some software approaches not related to the CarND. To be specific, in this repo, it will at 
least initially be about: 

* The [Elegoo UNO Project Smart Robot Car Kit](https://www.elegoo.com/product/elegoo-uno-project-smart-robot-car-kit-v1-0/)
* The Raspberry Pi platform
* C/C++, possibly Qt
* The [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest) unit test framework
* State inference using stuff like Hidden Markov Models, (extended) Kalman filters etc
  - I think I will also try to sketch some kind of brief document explaining some of these mathematical / statistical
    concepts, mainly with the aim of organizing my own thoughts and findings

That is about it for now. Let us see when I get to actually write some code.
